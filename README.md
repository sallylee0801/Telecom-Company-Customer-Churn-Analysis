## Business Objective
We aim to leverage the customer churn data to explore the factors influencing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By examining the association between monthly charges, payment methods, and churn status, the objective is to develop targeted pricing and retention strategies to reduce churn rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable business growth.

## Data Sources
We utilized the Telco-Customer-Churn dataset which comprises 21 columns and 7043 rows. We will focus on key features such as churn status, monthly charges, total charges, tenure, and payment methods.

## EDA
After analysis of data distributions and performing statistics tests, we identified four findings that guided our final investigations:
1. **Monthly Charges and Churn**: Robust linear and monotonic relationship observed between monthly charges and average monthly charges, indicating a strong association between the variables.
2. **Churn and Payment Methods**: Significant relationship found between churn status and preferred payment methods, supported by statistical analysis.
3. **Churn Status Impact on Monthly Charges**: Churning customers exhibit higher average monthly charges, though the effect size is relatively small.
4. **Variations in Monthly Charges**: Significant difference observed in average monthly charges between churning and non-churning customers.

## Insights: We have identified 4 key features and associations that affect the customer churn status:
1. Strong correlation between monthly charges and churn status, emphasizing the need for targeted pricing strategies.
